The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 35.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 139.8 hours of data, or 89.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,26.4,82)
