The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 37.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 138.7 hours of data, or 86.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,28.6,88)
