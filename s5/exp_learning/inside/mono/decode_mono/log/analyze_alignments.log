The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 38.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.3 hours of data, or 1.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (26,40.3,127)
