The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 38.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 139.4 hours of data, or 85.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,33.2,87)
