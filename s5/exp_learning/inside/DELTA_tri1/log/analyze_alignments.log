The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 38.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 138.9 hours of data, or 86.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (19,30.3,90)
